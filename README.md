# Thermo-Analytics

This repository stores source code for state variable analytics, through C++ dynamic link libraries (DLL’s) and Visual Basis for Application, in Microsoft® Excel® for Microsoft 64-bit spreadsheets. The state variable properties can be used in thermodynamic calculations and analytics. The engine state variables include pressure, temperature, entropy, and enthalpy.

The code provides an equation of state based on the Benedict–Webb–Rubin-Starling (BWRS) model.

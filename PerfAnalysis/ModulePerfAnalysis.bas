' =============================================================================
' Function Name:  CompExp
' Name: CompExp
' Purpose: Retrieves the chamber pressure at a particular crank angle for a given
'          suction pressure, discharge pressure, isentropic exponent, and compressor
'          kinematic arrangement. It returns a -1 value for any error.
'          It serves as a wrapper for the CCOMPEXP DLL function.
'
' Parameters:
' - connrodlength: The connecting rod length in USCS units, inches
' - stroke: The compressor stroke in USCS units, inches.
' - bore: The bore diameter in USCS units, inches.
' - rod: The rod diameter in USCS units, inches.
' - crankangle: The crank angle in degrees.
' - clearance: The clearance in percentage.
' - nexp: The polytropic expansion exponent (unitless).
' - ncomp: The polytropic compression exponent (unitless).
' - psuct: The absolute suction pressure in USCS units, PSIA.
' - pdish: The absolute discharge pressure in USCS units, PSIA.
' - headend: A boolean value set to true for the head end or false for the crank end.
'
' Returns:
' - Double: pressure calculated in USCS units, PSIA
'
' Error Handling:
' The function has built-in error handling which returns a -1 for any error.
'
' Notes:
' - The function relies on the CCOMPEXP function and handles its return values and errors
